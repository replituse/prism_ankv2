Apply Below Fixes & Enhancements

Important:
Work only on my existing project.
Do NOT change major functionality, structure, database schema, or overall design.
Only fix, align, and enhance features exactly as mentioned.

1️⃣ Chalan Report – Fix Amount / Rs. Text Overlap

Issue seen in Chalan Report (uploaded image):

Required Fix:

Fix overlapping amount text (Rs. values overflowing or merging).

Ensure:

Rs. and amount are displayed cleanly and readable.

Text does not overflow outside the column.

Amount column width adjusts properly.

Use proper number formatting (example: Rs. 25,000.00).

Keep column layout intact; do not expand filter section width.

2️⃣ UI Color Consistency Across Project

Make UI color consistent across entire project.

Required:

Use same background color for:

Operation / Master / Reports / Utility sidebar buttons

Schedule Booking button

New Booking button

Header PRISM background

All buttons across project should follow same theme color.

No redesign — only color alignment.

3️⃣ Chalan Revise – Proper Flow & Unique Chalan ID

Fix and standardize Chalan Revise functionality.

Requirements:

Chalan Entry & Chalan Revise must:

Follow same unique Chalan ID logic

Format: CHYYMM-XX

Example: CH2502-01, CH2502-02

YY = Year, MM = Month, XX = monthly sequence

Chalan Revise flow:

Open revise in new full screen, not popup

Load existing chalan details correctly

Save revised data under same Chalan ID

Maintain revision history internally

Ensure proper backend logic, no duplicate IDs.

4️⃣ Conflict Report – Proper Resolve & Data Sync

Improve conflict resolution logic.

Keep This Button:

Accept selected booking

Automatically cancel or mark conflicting bookings

Remove resolved conflict from conflict report

Update Button:

Open booking edit screen

Allow changing:

Time

Room

Editor

After update:

Conflict should be resolved

Record removed from conflict report

Updated data must reflect correctly in:

Dashboard

Chalan

Reports

5️⃣ Remove Activity History from Utility

Completely remove/delete Activity History section from Utility module.

No UI entry, no menu item, no routing.

Do not affect other modules.

6️⃣ Unified History Button with Date Filter

Implement one consistent History feature.

Requirements:

Add History button (similar to Leaves Entry) in:

Chalan Entry

Chalan Revise

Master modules

History view must:

Open in full screen or modal (as existing pattern)

Include Date filter

Show:

Who edited

What changed

Date & time

Use same history logic, no duplication.

UI must be clean and readable.

7️⃣ User Rights – Strict View-Only Access Fix

Fix user permission enforcement.

Required Behavior:

If admin gives a user:

Booking → View only

Chalan Entry → View only

Then user must:

See only Booking & Chalan modules

Be able to view only

NOT be able to:

Edit

Delete

Cancel

Revise

Create

Enforce permissions on:

UI level (buttons hidden/disabled)

Backend level (API protection)

Ensure permissions work correctly for all roles.

⚠️ Important Notes

Do NOT change DB structure unless unavoidable.

Do NOT redesign UI — only fixes & alignment.

Do NOT break existing workflow.

Follow current coding patterns.
